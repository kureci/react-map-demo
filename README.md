This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction
This is a simple demonstration of basic React skills through an SPA that uses a backend API to show vehicles on a map.

## Installation and starting up
You know the drill ;)

```
git clone https://github.com/kureci/react-map-demo.git
cd react-map-demo
npm install
```

and then followed by

`npm start`

which runs the app in the development mode.<br>


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
